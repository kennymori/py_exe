# Week 2 :Learning Foundamental Packages for Data Analysis

## Abstract

> (e.g. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn etc)

#### [Required]

1. **Numpy** is really fast,  it has bindings to C libraries. For more info on why Arrays are better than lists, check out this great [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/why-numpy-instead-of-python-lists). Learning numpy should not take you more than a day or two.
2. **Pandas** is like an extremely powerful version of Excel, with a ton of more features. You need to cover the following topics inside of pandas – Series, DataFrames, GroupBy, Merging, Joining and  Concatenating Operations.
3. **Matplotlib** is made to have a very similar feel to Matlab’s graphical plotting features, it is the most common plotting library out there.
4. **Seaborn** is built on Matplotlib, it is famous for its very beautiful statistical plotting capabilities.
5. Use the <u>given data set</u>, you will do an analysis on it and produce a simple report with your insight for it.

#### [Optional]
